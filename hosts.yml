    #### SASL Authentication Configuration ####
    ## By default there will be no SASL Authentication
    ## For SASL/PLAIN uncomment this line:
    # sasl_protocol: plain
    ## For SASL/SCRAM uncomment this line:
    # sasl_protocol: scram
    ## For SASL/GSSAPI uncomment this line and see Kerberos Configuration properties below
    # sasl_protocol: kerberos

    #### Kerberos Configuration ####
    ## Applicable when sasl_protocol is kerberos
    # kerberos_kafka_broker_primary: <Name of the primary set on the kafka brokers' principal eg. kafka>
    ## REQUIRED: Under each host set keytab file path and principal name, see below
    # kerberos_configure: <Boolean for ansible to install kerberos packages and configure this file: /etc/krb5.conf, defaults to true>
    # kerberos:
    #   realm: <KDC server realm eg. confluent.example.com>
    #   kdc_hostname: <hostname of machine with KDC running eg. ip-172-31-45-82.us-east-2.compute.internal>
    #   admin_hostname: <hostname of machine with KDC running eg. ip-172-31-45-82.us-east-2.compute.internal>

    #### TLS Configuration ####
    ## By default, data will NOT be encrypted. To turn on TLS encryption, uncomment this line
    # ssl_enabled: true
    ## By default, the components will be configured with One-Way TLS, to turn on TLS mutual auth, uncomment this line:
    # ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: true
    ## By default, the certs for this configuration will be self signed, to deploy custom certificates there are two options.
    ## Option 1: Custom Certs
    ## You will need to provide the path to the Certificate Authority Cert used to sign each hosts' certs
    ## As well as the signed certificate path and the key for that certificate for each host.
    ## These will need to be set for the correct host
    # ssl_custom_certs: true
    # ssl_ca_cert_filepath: "/tmp/certs/ca.crt"
    # ssl_signed_cert_filepath: "/tmp/certs/{{inventory_hostname}}-signed.crt"
    # ssl_key_filepath: "/tmp/certs/{{inventory_hostname}}-key.pem"
    ## Option 2: Custom Keystores and Truststores
    ## CP-Ansible can move keystores/truststores to their corresponding hosts and configure the components to use them. Set These vars
    # ssl_provided_keystore_and_truststore: true
    # ssl_keystore_filepath: "/tmp/certs/{{inventory_hostname}}-keystore.jks"
    # ssl_keystore_key_password: mystorepassword
    # ssl_keystore_store_password: mystorepassword
    # ssl_truststore_filepath: "/tmp/certs/truststore.jks"
    # ssl_truststore_password: truststorepass

    #### Monitoring Configuration ####
    ## Jolokia is enabled by default. The Jolokia jar gets pulled from the internet and enabled on all the components
    ## To disable, uncomment this line:
    # jolokia_enabled: false
    ## During setup, the hosts will download the jolokia agent jar from Maven. To update that jar download set this var
    # jolokia_jar_url: http://<inteneral-server>/jolokia-jvm-1.6.2-agent.jar
    ## JMX Exporter is disabled by default. When enabled, JMX Exporter jar will be pulled from the Internet and enabled on the broker *only*.
    ## To enable, uncomment this line:
    # jmxexporter_enabled: true
    ## To update that jar download set this var
    # jmxexporter_jar_url: http://<internal-server>/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.12.0.jar

    #### Custom Yum Repo File (Rhel/Centos) ####
    ## If you are using your own yum repo server to host the packages, in the case of an air-gapped environment,
    ## use the below variables to distribute a custom .repo file to the hosts and skip our repo setup.
    ## Note, your repo server must host all confluent packages
    # custom_yum_repofile: true
    # custom_yum_repofile_filepath: /tmp/my-repo.repo

    #### Custom Apt Repo File (Ubuntu/Debian) ####
    ## If you are using your own apt repo server to host the packages, in the case of an air-gapped environment,
    ## use the below variables to distribute a custom .repo file to the hosts and skip our repo setup.
    ## Note, your repo server must host all confluent packages
    # custom_apt_repo: true
    # custom_apt_repo_filepath: "/tmp/my-source.list"

    #### Configuring Different Security on both Listeners ####
    ## CP-Ansible will configure two listeners on the broker: an internal listener for the broker to communicate and an external for the components and other clients.
    ## If you only need one listener uncomment this line:
    # kafka_broker_configure_additional_brokers: false
    ## By default both of these listeners will follow whatever you set for ssl_enabled and sasl_protocol.
    ## To configure different security settings on the internal and external listeners set the following variables:
    # kafka_broker_custom_listeners:
    #   internal:
    #     name: INTERNAL
    #     port: 9091
    #     ssl_enabled: false
    #     ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: false
    #     sasl_protocol: none
    #   external:
    #     name: EXTERNAL
    #     port: 9092
    #     ssl_enabled: true
    #     ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: false
    #     sasl_protocol: scram
    ## You can even add additional listeners, make sure all variables are set
    #   client_listener:
    #     name: CLIENT
    #     port: 9093
    #     ssl_enabled: true
    #     ssl_mutual_auth_enabled: true
    #     sasl_protocol: scram
